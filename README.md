# Selling Your Car? Don’t Miss These 7 Important Steps!
Have you been looking to sell your vehicle? It’s not always easy to work out how to sell your car safely, but there are several options you should be aware of to help. Fortunately, our experts have summarized some of the seven key steps you should take to help sell your car safely and successfully.

### Seven Important Steps to Sell Your Car
Car sales aren’t necessarily an easy process. However, with the following seven steps, things can become a lot easier overall.
### #1 Value the Vehicle
One of the first things you should do before selling your car is to check its value. A [hpi check](https://fullcarchecks.co.uk/) includes the valuation along with a comprehnsivery history check on the car. This can help you decide whether or not now is the right time to sell; it can also give you a clearer understanding of how much to ask for your car. 
There’s no point in overpricing your vehicle, as you’ll likely struggle to sell it. However, undervaluing your car could leave you massively out of pocket. Why risk it? 

### #2 Get the Car Looking Clean
Before you can begin trying to sell, you’ll want to get your car looking in top condition – and a quck clean up is one of the best options to this end. Make sure to polish inside and out to ensure the vehicle looks great, and try to get on top of other important factors at this time, such as oil levels.
### #3 Collate Documents
Now that you know how much your car’s worth, you’ll want to collate all the documents you’ll need to sell. These include registration and insurance history as well as MOT and [repair details](https://www.hse.gov.uk/mvr/introduction.htm). Your client can always check these details with a car history check, so make sure to be open and honest with this. 
### #4 Advertise
At this point, you’ve got everything ready to sell your car – but how does anyone know you’re planning to get rid of it? While you could rely on word of mouth, a better solution if you want to get a quick sale is to advertise with online platforms. 
Online selling sites are incredibly easy to use; simply upload your car’s details and a picture of the vehicle, and wait to see if anyone gets in touch.
### #5 Screen Buyers
Selling a car isn’t a short-winded process; in line with this, it’s important to ensure that any potential buyer is genuine before going ahead with things. As such, screening interested individuals can be a good way to reduce the risk of time wasting.
### #6 Discussions
In some cases, buyers may be happy with the trade at the outset. However, it’s not uncommon for individuals to negotiate on the price, often giving several different reasons for this (or sometimes just asking for a discount). 
Whatever the case might be, it’s important to know what you’d be willing to accept and work from there. If your asking price is already the best you can do, don’t feel pressured into having to accept.
### #7 Complete the Sale
At this point, if everyone’s happy with the negotiated price and/or terms, all that’s left is to close the sale. The buyer should receive all documentation and a [sale receipt](https://www.moneyhelper.org.uk/en/everyday-money/buying-and-running-a-car/selling-your-car) to protect everyone involved.
